# Stripe Payment Integration Setup

This guide explains how to set up and use the Stripe payment integration in the KK Beauty e-commerce application.

## Features Implemented

✅ **Checkout Page** - Complete checkout flow with payment form
✅ **Stripe Elements Integration** - Secure card input with Stripe Elements
✅ **Order Summary** - Displays cart items and calculates totals
✅ **Payment Processing** - Mock payment service ready for backend integration
✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices
✅ **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Components Created

### 1. Checkout Page (`src/pages/Checkout.tsx`)
- Main checkout page that combines payment form and order summary
- Handles empty cart state
- Responsive grid layout

### 2. CheckoutForm (`src/components/Checkout/CheckoutForm.tsx`)
- Stripe Elements integration for secure card input
- Customer information form (name, email, address)
- Payment processing with loading states
- Error handling and success feedback

### 3. OrderSummary (`src/components/Checkout/OrderSummary.tsx`)
- Displays cart items with images and quantities
- Calculates subtotal, shipping, tax, and grand total
- Security information display

### 4. StripeProvider (`src/components/Checkout/StripeProvider.tsx`)
- Wraps checkout components with Stripe Elements provider
- Configurable with your Stripe publishable key

### 5. Payment Service (`src/services/paymentService.ts`)
- Mock payment service for demonstration
- Ready for backend integration
- Handles payment intents and confirmations

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
The Stripe packages have already been installed:
```bash
npm install @stripe/stripe-js @stripe/react-stripe-js
```

### 2. Configure Stripe Keys
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key_here
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

### 3. Get Your Stripe Keys
1. Sign up for a Stripe account at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Go to the Stripe Dashboard
3. Navigate to Developers > API keys
4. Copy your publishable key (starts with `pk_test_` for test mode)
5. Add it to your `.env` file

### 4. Backend Integration (Optional)
For production use, you'll need a backend server to handle payment processing securely. The payment service is set up to work with a backend API.

Example backend endpoints needed:
- `POST /api/create-payment-intent` - Create payment intent
- `POST /api/confirm-payment` - Confirm payment with payment method
- `GET /api/payment-status/:id` - Get payment status

## Usage

### Testing the Payment Flow
1. Add items to your cart from the Products page
2. Navigate to the Cart page
3. Click "Proceed to Checkout"
4. Fill in the payment form with test card details
5. Submit the payment

### Test Card Numbers
Use these Stripe test card numbers:
- **Success**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Decline**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- **Requires Authentication**: `4000 0025 0000 3155`

Use any future expiry date and any 3-digit CVC.

## Customization

### Styling
All components use styled-components and follow the existing design system. You can customize:
- Colors and themes in `src/theme.ts`
- Component styles in their respective `.tsx` files
- Stripe Elements styling in `CheckoutForm.tsx`

### Payment Flow
Modify the payment processing logic in:
- `CheckoutForm.tsx` - Frontend payment handling
- `paymentService.ts` - Backend communication
- `StripeProvider.tsx` - Stripe configuration

### Order Summary
Customize calculations in `OrderSummary.tsx`:
- Tax rates
- Shipping costs
- Discount logic

## Security Considerations

1. **Never expose your Stripe secret key** in the frontend
2. **Always process payments on the backend** using your secret key
3. **Use HTTPS** in production
4. **Validate all inputs** on both frontend and backend
5. **Handle webhooks** for payment status updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Stripe is not defined"**
   - Check that Stripe packages are installed
   - Verify your publishable key is correct

2. **Payment form not loading**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify StripeProvider is wrapping the checkout components

3. **Payment failing**
   - Use correct test card numbers
   - Check that all required fields are filled
   - Verify backend API is running (if using real backend)

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by adding to your `.env`:
```env
REACT_APP_DEBUG=true
```

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Integration**: Implement the payment endpoints on your backend server
2. **Webhook Handling**: Set up webhooks for payment status updates
3. **Order Management**: Create order tracking and management system
4. **Email Notifications**: Send confirmation emails after successful payments
5. **Analytics**: Track payment success rates and user behavior
